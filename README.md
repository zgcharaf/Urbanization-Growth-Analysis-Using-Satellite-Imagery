# Urbanization Growth Analysis Using Satellite Imagery 🌍🛰️

## Project Overview 📌

This project aims to analyze the patterns of urban growth and its impact on home prices using satellite images from 2015 to 2017. Utilizing data from Google Earth Engine, we gather monthly snapshots to observe and predict the trends in urbanization one year beyond the collected data. This study serves as a valuable tool for urban planners, economists, and policymakers.

## Data Collection 🗃️

### Sources
- **Google Earth Engine** 🌐: Satellite images for the city of Tangier, Morocco collected monthly from January 2015 to December 2017.

### Data Description
Each image in the dataset captures:
- High-resolution geographical imagery of urban areas 🏙️
- Timestamps for temporal analysis ⏳

## Methodology 🛠️

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collect monthly satellite images from Google Earth Engine.
2. **Image Processing**: Standardize and preprocess images for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Employ statistical and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and predict future urbanization.
4. **Visualization**: Create visual representations of urban growth over the study period.

## Predictive Modeling 📈

The project employs various predictive models to estimate urban growth trends a year after the last collected data. These models help in understanding potential impacts on home prices and urban planning.
